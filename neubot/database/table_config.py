 Config table.
 The config table is like a dictionary and keeps some useful
 variables.  It keeps the version of the database format, that
 might be useful in the future to convert an old database to
 a new one, should we change the format.

 <on uuid and privacy>
 It also keeps an unique identifier for each neubot client
 which we believe would help data analysis, e.g. we could
 review the measurement history of a given neubot looking for
 certain patterns, such as the connection speed decreasing
 near the end of the month because the user exceeded a
 bandwidth cap.

 We believe this should have a negligible impact on privacy
 because it would, at most, allow to say that neubot XYZ owner
 changed IP address, and hence, possibly, provider and/or
 location (and note that this information is functional to
 our goal of building a network neutrality map organized by
 geographic location and provider).

 So, we believe you should not be concerned by this issue,
 but, in case you were, the way to go is `neubot database -f`
 that forces neubot to generate and use A NEW uuid.
